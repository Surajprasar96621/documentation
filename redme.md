# React and Babel Q&A

## What is React?
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables developers to create interactive UI components that efficiently update and render as the application's state changes.

## Who made React?
React was developed by Facebook.

## What is Babel?
Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ (ES6+) code into a backward-compatible version of JavaScript that can be run in older browsers or environments. It is widely used in the JavaScript ecosystem for transpiling code.

## How does Babel convert HTML code in React into valid code?
Babel does not directly convert HTML code into React components. Instead, it transpiles JSX (JavaScript XML) syntax, which is often used in React code, into regular JavaScript code that browsers can understand. JSX allows developers to write HTML-like syntax within JavaScript code, making it easier to define React components.

## What is ReactDOM used for? Write an example.
ReactDOM is a package in React used for rendering React components in the DOM (Document Object Model). It provides methods for mounting and updating React components within a web page.

Example:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

const App = () => {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
